There are few really good frameworks out there that will provide you with the HUD style interface. This is where the big change in BGHUDAppKit becomes clear. I use absolutely	NO resources or images to give these controls the HUD appearance. BGHUDAppKit uses 100% native Cocoa drawing functions like NSColor, NSGradient and NSBezierPath. Because	of this the framework is much smaller, provides a cleaner interface and the biggieâ€¦it is already Resolution Independence ready. And of course it is free and open-source."
